# water-quality-check
In this project, we are dealing with the concept of water quality check. Generally, the water quality can be decided using many factors like pH value, turbidity, electrical 
conductivity, oxidation value, temperature, etc. Here, we find the quality of water which is present in rivers, ponds, lakes, etc using sensors like pH sensor, turbidity sensor, 
electrical conductivity sensor and temperature sensor. We write the program for web interface and for sensors like pH, turbidity, electrical conductivity and 
temprature using arduino IDE and display the quality of water to the user through internet.
